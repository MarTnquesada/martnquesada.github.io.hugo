> ml is not intellectually fulfilling, explain why for me it's more intellectually stimulating to learn databases or be proficient at hard languages

If you cannot potentially come up with anything new, or more efficient, then it needs to be fun. I have covered the previous bases, and it was not fun either, so why bother.

And it is because something new or better in some way becomes important. In my limited experience, things worth a significant investment are either important or fun. 
In the past, I have tried many times to like disciplines, ideas and works when they were not either of those. And it has never worked when I needed to do them long-term or become good at it.
Most of the time I would have been better off just putting in the effort to understand what they were and giving them a try, until I had enough of them.

Please do not mistake these words with me telling you some variation of "If it doesn't come naturally leave it". 
Important things are worth doing, but they often do not come naturally at all.
