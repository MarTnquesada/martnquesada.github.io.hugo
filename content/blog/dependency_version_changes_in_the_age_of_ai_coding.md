Introducing breaking changes into software libraries has become even more problematic in the age of AI coding.
Because the documentation for older versions needs to remain available, but this confuses AI in a way that is hard to work around.
(put the example of updating a file with htmx.ajax https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/issues/2630).

This is even more important now that StackOverflow is basically dead and docs and GitHub issues have become the only source of truth.
