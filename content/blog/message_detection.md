For quite some time I have been ruminating about a particular type of task that 
walks the line between several machine learning areas. I am talking about the task 
of differentiating messages or any sort of features that contain meaning from 
*the rest*. From every single other thing that cannot be interpreted as a
piece of information to be understood. Separating a newspaper from a sofa. 
Bird vocalization from the birds themselves. Or smoke signals from a regular cloud.

### 1. Who is the emitter
The first and most defining feature of interpretable information is that it necessarily has to come
from an organism. This distinction is necessary to make the task approachable, even if
it is leaving the metaphysical out of the equation. I would agree that a complete definition of meaning
cannot leave out everything other than living organisms, whose definition is already fragile,
and ignore the possibility of extracting meaning from the logos. So if you wish to be fully
correct, we can change this task's name to *organism message detection*.

Life is currently the only example for which we have ample data of entities emitting interpretable
information, so it follows that we have to validate whichever system we build over the chirping of birds,
graffiti, a tweet or any other cry for attention coming from an organism. However, this gives us 
an enormous range of possibilities and ways to communicate that look as different from each other as
a plane's lights in the night do from a shooting star. 

### 2. Degrees of meaning
So we cannot just take this task as a binary classification affair. There is a spectrum to the complexity of 

### 3. Why even get into this
