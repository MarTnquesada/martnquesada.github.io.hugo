If the heading is right you'll see my name in large letters at the top. I studied both my degree in computer science and a later master's in the Polytechnic University of Valencia. 
My academic projects have been mostly concerned with natural language processing, particularly unsupervised translation through the use of word embeddings.
I now work as a backend engineer integrating and maintaining NLP solutions and adjacent stuff.
