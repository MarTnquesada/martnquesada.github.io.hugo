Well met! I am Martín, if the large web header has not given that away already.
I work mostly as a data scientist / ML Engineer (what are job descriptions in tech?), and I am specialized in natural language processing.

If you wish to contact me, please do it through email, at mquesadazaragoza@gmail.com.

**Things I have made that you may want to use:**
- [Tokenaisu](https://github.com/MarTnquesada/tokenaisu), a collection of tokenizers made _fast_.

**Publications:**
- [Limitations and Challenges of Unsupervised Cross-lingual Pre-training
Limitations and Challenges of Unsupervised Cross-lingual Pre-training](https://aclanthology.org/2022.amta-research.13/) -
